# Simple DEX

This is a simple decentralized exchange (DEX) built with Next.js and integrated with Metamask. I plan on creating variations of this app in multiple languages (f sharp, haskel, rust etc)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, first clone the repository:

```
git clone <https://github.com/username/repo.git>

```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```
cd repo
npm install

```

Next, start the development server:

```
npm run dev

```

You can then view the project locally by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser.

## Features

The Simple DEX app allows users to:

- Connect their Metamask wallet
- Swap between two ERC-20 tokens
- View their accumulated points and exchange history

- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes
